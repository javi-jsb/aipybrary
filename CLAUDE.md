Book library REST API built with Python, FastAPI, and SQLModel.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.13 |
| Framework | FastAPI (`fastapi[standard]`) |
| ORM | SQLModel |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Docker for local dev) |
| Package manager | uv |
| Linting & formatting | Ruff |
| Testing | pytest + pytest-asyncio |

## Development Conventions

### Commits — Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short description>
```

| Type | When |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `chore` | Maintenance (deps, config, tooling) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Tests only |

### Branch naming

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Examples: `feat/5-add-book-endpoint`, `fix/12-null-author-crash`, `chore/1-create-claude-md`

### Commit granularity

Commits within a PR must be grouped by logical section, not bundled into a single monolithic commit. Each commit should represent a cohesive unit of work (e.g., dependencies, domain layer, infrastructure, tests). This makes the PR easier to review commit-by-commit.

### Pull Requests

- Every PR must reference its issue with `Closes #N` **in the PR body**, not in individual commits — the close trigger fires on squash merge via the PR description
- PR title follows the same Conventional Commits format as the branch
- Merge strategy: **squash merge** — keeps `main` history linear; GitHub uses the PR title as the resulting commit message

### Dependencies

Pinning policy:

- All direct dependencies in `pyproject.toml` use exact version pins (`package==X.Y.Z`), both runtime and dev
- `uv.lock` is committed; it pins transitive dependencies and SHA256 hashes
- Upgrades are deliberate: `uv add "package==X.Y.Z"` or edit `pyproject.toml` and run `uv sync`
- Every PR that modifies `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` must have its dependency diff reviewed explicitly before merge
- In automated environments (CI, prod, once they exist), use `uv sync --frozen` so resolution is forbidden

### OpenSpec workflow

OpenSpec changes live under `openspec/changes/<change-name>/` while active. Once a change is complete (all tasks done, all artifacts marked done), it must be **archived through its own dedicated issue + PR** — never folded into the implementation PR, never a direct commit to `main`.

Archive issue/branch/PR convention:

- Issue title: `chore(openspec): archive '<change-name>' change`
- Branch: `chore/<N>-archive-<change-name>`
- The PR syncs each delta spec into `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` and moves the change directory to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>/`.

## Language

All public-facing content must be written in **English**: issues, PR titles and descriptions, commit messages, code, comments, and documentation.

## AI Collaboration Rules

**Debate before executing.** If something seems wrong, missing, inconsistent, or improvable, raise it and discuss options before proceeding. Do not execute blindly.

**Keep this file up to date.** If during development a decision is made, a convention is added, or anything worth documenting changes, update `CLAUDE.md` accordingly in the same PR where the change happens.
