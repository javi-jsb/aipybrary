## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tools** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them. `codegraph_node` returns one symbol's source + callers, or reads a whole file with line numbers. If the tools are listed but deferred, load them by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` and `codegraph node <symbol-or-file>` print the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.

## CodeGraph — usage notes (this repo)

This repo is indexed. Default to CodeGraph before grep/read.

The MCP tools arrive deferred each session. Load them with the fully-qualified `mcp__codegraph__` prefix — e.g. `select:mcp__codegraph__codegraph_explore`. The bare short name does not match in `select:`.
